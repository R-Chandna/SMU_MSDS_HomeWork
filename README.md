# SMU_MSDS_HomeWork

Purpose:
Repo Created for Storing the SMU MSDS Homework Assignment Files. Currently this directory contains following sub directory:
MSDS 6306_Doing_Data_Science: This directory contains the homework for each week in MSDS 6306 class. Each Week has its own sub directory under which data sets, R Code files and R Markdown; and HTML files for presentation are located. Individual README files under each week's sub directory contains more information on organization of information for that particular week. In general, each week's directory would contain a folder Analysis: Under which R or R Markdown code would be stored and this folder would also contain a sub folder: Data: Under which Raw Data Sets, Tidy Data Sets, Code Book etc would be placed.   

Sources of Material for this Directory mainly consist of:
1. Data Sets: Collected from various websites as fivethirtyeight.com etc, datasets shared from fellow students' public repos, datasets shared by instructors for the courses etc.
2. Code files: These contain the code that I have written for cleaning, transforming and analyzing the various data sets.
3. Presentation files: There are markdown files integrating my code and results together for presentation.
